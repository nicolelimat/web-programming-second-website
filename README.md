# web-programming-second-website

Welcome to my second website repository! This project was developed as an assignment for my Web Programming course, taught by Professor Rodrigo Martins Pagliares. 

For this assignment, I recreated the content and design of my [first website](#related-projects) using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This allowed me to delve into the fundamentals of web development and gain a deeper understanding of the technologies powering modern websites.
